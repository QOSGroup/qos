# Transactions

We introduce approve txs hereï¼Œthese txs affect [State](2_state.md).

## TxCreateApprove

### Struct
[Sending TxCreateApprove](../../command/qoscli.md#create-approve) to create an `approve`. The struct of this tx is:
```go
type TxCreateApprove struct {
	types.Approve
}
```
[Approve](2_state.md#Approve) is the common struct of `TxCreateApprove`,[TxIncreaseApprove](#txincreaseapprove),[TxDecreaseApprove](#txdecreaseapprove),[TxUseApprove](#txuseapprove).

### Validations

This tx is expected to fail if:
- `from`,`to` can not be empty, can not be the same.
- `coins`are all positive and no duplicate.
- account of `from` must exists.
- no approve from `from` to `to` exists.
