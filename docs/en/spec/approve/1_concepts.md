Approve is to allow existing accounts on the QOS network to authorize other accounts to use their own QOS or QSC tokens.

QOS encourages users to use the approve function, so QOS sets the transaction `Gas` for approve transactions to 0, and only charges a very small amount of `Gas` generated by the database operation.
